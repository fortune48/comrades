  <div>Just over a year ago, we became fascinated by the idea of discovering the world through 
    someone's eyes. What if you could see through the eyes of a protester in Ukraine? Or 
    watch the sunrise from a hot air balloon in Cappadocia? It may sound crazy, but we 
    wanted to build the closest thing to teleportation. While there are many ways to 
    discover events and places, we realized there is no better way to experience a place 
    right now than through live video. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but live 
    video can take you someplace and show you around.</div>
